This is a python project includes python with MySQL connectivity.
In this, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are all performed.
Also we can write direct query as per our need.
Several functions are made for the operations.
Firstly, we have created a database i.e., a database named "kp" is already created and the table is already created with some columns.
Then, we have performed operations on that using python mysql connectivity.
